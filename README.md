# PyBer_Analysis
Python Pandas and Visualizations: Analyze all rideshare data from early May 2019
## Background

In this challenge, I used my Python skills as well as my knowledge of the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries in Jupyter Notebook to create a summary DataFrame.

## Objectives 
The goals for this challenge are for you to:

Use Pandas functions like groupby, pivot, resample, and reset_index on a DataFrame.
Use Pandas methods and attributes on a DataFrame or Series.
Create a new DataFrame from multiple groupby() Series.
Format columns of a DataFrame.
Create a multiple-line graph.
Annotate and apply styling to the chart.

#Part 1 Instructions
##Create a PyBer Summary DataFrame
Create a summary DataFrame that showcases the following for each city type:

Total Rides
Total Drivers
Total Fares
Average Fare per Ride
Average Fare per Driver

There are a lot less Rural Rides (125). And the top most rides are Urban. This in aligment as per expectation but it is a higher rate on the average Rural Fare per ride, wheere in rural is $34.62, Suburban is $30.97 and Urban is $24.53. 

We can also see that the Average Fare per Driver is some times 4 times higher in rural areas, we can see this is the impact of having a lot less drivers available 78 vs 490 for suburban areas and 2,405 for the Urban areas. This is very interesting data.


#Part 2 Instructions
## Create a Multiple-Line Plot for the Sum of the Fares for Each City Type

# PyBer_Analysis
Python Pandas and Visualizations: Analyze all rideshare data from early May 2019
## Background

In this challenge, I used my Python skills as well as my knowledge of the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries in Jupyter Notebook to create a summary DataFrame.

## Objectives 
The goals for this challenge are for you to:

Use Pandas functions like groupby, pivot, resample, and reset_index on a DataFrame.
Use Pandas methods and attributes on a DataFrame or Series.
Create a new DataFrame from multiple groupby() Series.
Format columns of a DataFrame.
Create a multiple-line graph.
Annotate and apply styling to the chart.

#Part 1 Instructions
##Create a PyBer Summary DataFrame
Create a summary DataFrame that showcases the following for each city type:

Total Rides
Total Drivers
Total Fares
Average Fare per Ride
Average Fare per Driver
Your final summary DataFrame should look like this:

To create the summary DataFrame, follow these steps:

Get the total rides, total drivers, and total fares for each city type using the groupby() function on the city type using the merged DataFrame or separate DataFrames.
Calculate the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver by city type.
Delete the index name.
Create the summary DataFrame with the appropriate columns and apply formatting where appropriate.
